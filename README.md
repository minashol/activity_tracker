This is a classification project.

The data is about 10 participants doing several activities i.e walking upstairs, running, sitting, etc.

We use these data to train ML classification algorithms (SVMs, Decision Trees and MLPs)
in order to make predictions as accurate as possible. 

The training method used is LOSO (Leave One Subject Out), using 10-fold Cross Validation.
